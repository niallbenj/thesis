!
! Nodens = number of densities in loop
!
! Notemp = SET THIS EQUAL TO NUMBER IN ADF04
!
! mantmp = (Not sure why I did this yet) Can set a lower bound, i.e. use the 2nd energy in adf04
!
! sDens + fDens = start & finish, e.g. 10^2 -> 10^10 (integers relate to powers)
!
! IC = 1 intermediate coupling, or 0 for LS for the reading of ADF04
!
! popt = redundant at this time
!
! worder = 0 for no wavelength ordering. I’d recommend this to be zero unless you absolutely need them in order
!
! petol = some tolerance on the PEC absolute value. i.e. 10^(petol)
!
! wrngup + wrngdn = print a certain wavelength range for the PEC’s
!
! line = 1 is for a particular line ratio, e.g. uplev -> 1 / lolev -> 1
!      = 0 for no line ratio
! ppec = 1 for a particular PEC, defined by uppec and lopec
! 
! pops = 1 for all populations as a function of Ne and Te for contour plotting
!      = 0 for nothing..
